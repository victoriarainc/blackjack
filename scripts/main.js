   Implement a Blackjack hand value calculator.

   Open up the `index.html` file and your console

   Also remember, that the parameter `hand` will be an array, so
   you'll need to parse through that first before you can start to 
   write your logic.

1..10   ==> Worth face value (1 = 1, 4 = 4, etc)
K, Q, J ==> Worth 10
A       ==> Worth 1 or 11
